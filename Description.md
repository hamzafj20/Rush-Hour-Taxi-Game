The projects were all coded by Hamza Faheem (hamzafj20). 
Using the Irvine32 x86 Assembly library, I developed a Rush Hour Taxi Game where most of the game logic was implemented generically. The maze and graphics were rendered entirely in ASCII, and NPCs spawn at randomized locations to keep gameplay unique, different and dynamic.

To make the game more lively, some messages are references to the 1998 French film "Taxi".
